# trash
Tree visualization for bash scripts - because one developer's trash is another's treasure

First of all, the name : It's a mashup between tree and bash -> **trash** (and mostly because the name is funny)

The target of the project is to make a dependency analyzer for bash scripts that recursively maps source files, extracts variables, and generates interactive HTML visualizations.
